## Design
The Design of this project is based on 80's/90's over the top action films. I had a big enfeces on synthwave era with many insperations
coming from music, movies and games.
The design is a hud for a car that you can inpterpert to be wat you want it to be.
The car is based off of a car that you would find in action movies such as a lamborgini or a ferrari.
The hud has retro style electronics but mordernish aspects to them.
The car has crosshairs that I wanted it to shoot little alien ships but I had to leave out.
The car has a radar that is nice and fits the era well, I am proud of that one, it looks good.
The hud of the car is lovely and I really like how I captured the design of the car.
The screen will display a message but will also stop the program, I had bigger plans for this that I explained in the commits.
## Workings
The program is fairly basic.
The crosshairs move using 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' and has a glide to it as if the gun is slow and doesnt move all that fast.
The space key will play the sound of a laser shooting.
When you click it will bring up two messages on the screen and end the program.
## Insperations
I took alot of insperations from many sources when creating the design of the page.
I went through different medias and took a combination from them, here are some examples:
Escaper from la
Carpenter Brut
Hotline Miami
Farcry 3 Blood Dragon
I have an images folder that has pictures of them.
